# MyStoreProject - Ecommerce Automation

Welcome to MyStoreProject, an ecommerce automation project powered by Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and other powerful tools. This project focuses on automating various aspects of an ecommerce app, and it follows industry best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and efficiency.

## Project Overview

MyStoreProject is an ecommerce automation solution designed to simulate user interactions with an ecommerce application. The project utilizes Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, TestNG for test execution and management, Extent Report for comprehensive test reporting, and Log4j for logging.

## Key Features

- **Selenium WebDriver:** The project leverages Selenium WebDriver to perform automated interactions with the web application.
- **TestNG Framework:** TestNG is used for test execution, parallelization, and reporting, providing a robust testing infrastructure.
- **Extent Report:** Extent Reports generate detailed and user-friendly HTML reports, enhancing visibility into test results.
- **Log4j Logging:** Log4j ensures effective logging of events and actions, facilitating debugging and troubleshooting.
- **OOP Principles:** The project is structured according to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** The Page Object Model design pattern organizes web elements and actions into separate classes, improving test structure.
- **Page Chaining:** Support for page chaining allows efficient navigation and interaction across different pages.
